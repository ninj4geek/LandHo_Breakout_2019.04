Basically, it's breakout, the brick and paddle game. Writing in JavaFX Scenebuilder. 

(Right now, this is my think-out-loud notepad)

Need: 
(Visual items)
Background
Perimeter barrier 
Bricks, several rows
1 Ball (cannonball, per play)
1 Paddle (ship image)

(Functional)
Bouncing
  Paddle: reflection of the ball as a function of distance from centerpoint of the side being touched
    Center = reflect at 90째
    Edge = reflect at 0째
    Not center = reflect-- if (touchpoint > midpoint) then 90째 * (size - touchpoint) / (length/2) 
                           if (touchpoint < midpoint) then 90째 * (touchpoint) / (length/2)
  Bricks: reflect at same angle received, then take damage. 
  
Damage
   Brick HP = layer #. Each ball contact = 1 hp damage

Ball: Out of bounds when contact bottom layer
  

Win condition: Brick Count == 0.
Lose condition: out of balls (cannonballs)
